# NYC Street Tree Census Analysis (2015)

## Overview
This project analyzes the 2015 New York City Street Tree Census to explore tree health, species distribution, and geographic patterns across the city. The goal is to understand the composition and condition of NYC’s urban forest and identify trends that can inform environmental planning and maintenance strategies.

## Data Source
NYC Open Data – 2015 Street Tree Census  
Dataset ID: uvpi-gqnh

## Objectives
- Examine the distribution of tree species across NYC
- Analyze tree health conditions by borough
- Identify patterns related to tree size, condition, and location
- Explore potential environmental and maintenance insights

## Methods
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Univariate and bivariate analysis
- Aggregation and grouping by borough and species
- Data visualization to highlight patterns and disparities

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Findings
- Certain tree species dominate NYC’s urban forest
- Tree health varies noticeably by borough
- Larger tree populations are concentrated in specific geographic areas
- Maintenance and environmental factors may contribute to observed health differences

## Deliverables
- Jupyter Notebook containing full analysis
- Visualizations illustrating species distribution and tree health
- Summary insights for urban forestry planning

## Limitations
- Data reflects conditions from 2015 and may not represent current tree health
- Some variables contain missing or self-reported values
- No causal relationships are established

## Future Improvements
- Compare results with newer Street Tree Census datasets
- Incorporate geospatial mapping for enhanced visualization
- Analyze correlations with environmental or socioeconomic data
